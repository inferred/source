# Source

_A Java library for code generation._

This project is forked from [FreeBuilder], consisting of the `processor.util` and
`processor.util.testing` packages, now renamed `internal.source` and `internal.testing`.
It is intended for internal use in inferred.org code generation libraries, and no
guarantees of suitability for other uses are made or implied.

## Developers

**Source** is built with Gradle and developed with Eclipse. Useful commands:

 * `./gradlew check` — Run all checks
 * `./gradlew eclipse` — Configure Eclipse projects for import
